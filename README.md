# Colmar Academy
Colmar Academy is an mock academy website using just HTML and CSS.

The goal was to create a single page website user HTML and CSS as a capstone project for Codecademy.

# Concerns and Issues
- There is plenty of refactoring to be done in order to make cleaner and clearer code
- Would love to go back and remake this project with a frontend and backend
